📌 Project Overview
This project provides a data-driven deep dive into the performance of a high-volume food delivery platform. Using Tableau, I analyzed thousands of transactions to identify the drivers of customer satisfaction, delivery efficiency, and revenue growth. The dashboard serves as a strategic tool for managing vendor relationships and optimizing logistics.

📊 Key Insights
Revenue Leaders: Identified the top-performing food categories and specific vendors contributing the highest gross merchandise value (GMV).

Delivery Performance: Correlated delivery times with customer ratings to find the "sweet spot" for logistics—identifying exactly when delays begin to negatively impact brand loyalty.

Geospatial Hotspots: Mapped order density to identify high-demand zones, providing actionable data for targeted marketing and driver allocation.

Sentiment Analysis: Segmented customer reviews to uncover common pain points in the delivery experience, categorized by food type and time of day.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Advanced Visualizations: Utilized heat maps, dual-axis charts, and interactive scatter plots to visualize complex correlations.

Calculated Fields: Developed custom Tableau calculations for Average Order Value (AOV), Delivery Success Rates, and Customer Acquisition Costs.

Interactivity: Integrated dashboard actions, parameters, and tooltips to allow users to drill down from high-level city data to specific vendor performance.

Data Storytelling: Focused on a clean, high-contrast UI designed for executive-level presentations.
